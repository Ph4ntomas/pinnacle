# Introduction

Pinnacle is a Wayland compositor written with [Smithay](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay)
and configured in either Lua or Rust. It's my attempt at making something similar to
[AwesomeWM](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome) for Wayland.

This wiki will provide you with information on how to get Pinnacle
up and running as well as configured to your liking.
