//! Types for window rules.
//!
//! A window rule is a way to set the properties of a window on open.
//!
//! They are comprised of two parts: the [condition][WindowRuleCondition] and the actual [rule][WindowRule].
//!
//! # [`WindowRuleCondition`]s
//! `WindowRuleCondition`s are conditions that the window needs to open with in order to apply a
//! rule. For example, you may want to set a window to maximized if it has the class "steam", or
//! you might want to open all Firefox instances on tag "3".
//!
//! To do this, you must build a `WindowRuleCondition` to tell the compositor when to apply any
//! rules.
//!
//! ## Building `WindowRuleCondition`s
//! A condition is created through [`WindowRuleCondition::new`]:
//! ```
//! let cond = WindowRuleCondition::new();
//! ```
//!
//! In order to understand conditions, you must understand the concept of "any" and "all".
//!
//! **"Any"**
//!
//! "Any" conditions only need one of their constituent items to be true for the whole condition to
//! evaluate to true. Think of it as one big `if a || b || c || d || ... {}` block.
//!
//! **"All"**
//!
//! "All" conditions need *all* of their constituent items to be true for the condition to evaluate
//! to true. This is like a big `if a && b && c && d && ... {}` block.
//!
//! Note that any items in a top level `WindowRuleCondition` fall under "all", so all those items
//! must be true.
//!
//! With that out of the way, we can get started building conditions.
//!
//! ### `WindowRuleCondition::classes`
//! With [`WindowRuleCondition::classes`], you can specify what classes a window needs to have for
//! a rule to apply.
//!
//! The following will apply to windows with the class "firefox":
//! ```
//! let cond = WindowRuleCondition::new().classes(["firefox"]);
//! ```
//!
//! Note that you pass in some `impl IntoIterator<Item = impl Into<String>>`. This means you can
//! pass in more than one class here:
//! ```
//! let failing_cond = WindowRuleCondition::new().classes(["firefox", "steam"]);
//! ```
//! *HOWEVER*: this will not work. Recall that top level conditions are implicitly "all". This
//! means the above would require windows to have *both classes*, which is impossible. Thus, the
//! condition above will never be true.
//!
//! ### `WindowRuleCondition::titles`
//! Like `classes`, you can use `titles` to specify that the window needs to open with a specific
//! title for the condition to apply.
//!
//! ```
//! let cond = WindowRuleCondition::new().titles(["Steam"]);
//! ```
//!
//! Like `classes`, passing in multiple titles at the top level will cause the condition to always
//! fail.
//!
//! ### `WindowRuleCondition::tags`
//! You can specify that the window needs to open on the given tags in order to apply a rule.
//!
//! ```
//! let cond = WindowRuleCondition::new().tags([&tag.get("3", output.get_by_name("HDMI-1")?)?]);
//! ```
//!
//! Here, if you have tag "3" active on "HDMI-1" and spawn a window on that output, this condition
//! will apply.
//!
//! Unlike `classes` and `titles`, you can specify multiple tags at the top level:
//!
//! ```
//! let op = output.get_by_name("HDMI-1")?;
//! let tag1 = tag.get("1", &op)?;
//! let tag2 = tag.get("2", &op)?;
//!
//! let cond = WindowRuleCondition::new().tags([&tag1, &tag2]);
//! ```
//!
//! Now, you must have both tags "1" and "2" active and spawn a window for the condition to apply.
//!
//! ### `WindowRuleCondition::any`
//! Now we can get to ways to compose more complex conditions.
//!
//! `WindowRuleCondition::any` takes in conditions and will evaluate to true if *anything* in those
//! conditions are true.
//!
//! ```
//! let cond = WindowRuleCondition::new()
//!     .any([
//!         WindowRuleCondition::new().classes(["Alacritty"]),
//!         WindowRuleCondition::new().tags([&tag.get("2", None)?]),
//!     ]);
//! ```
//!
//! This condition will apply if the window is *either* "Alacritty" *or* opens on tag "2".
//!
//! ### `WindowRuleCondition::all`
//! With `WindowRuleCondition::all`, *all* specified conditions must be true for the condition to
//! be true.
//!
//! ```
//! let cond = WindowRuleCondition::new()
//!     .all([
//!         WindowRuleCondition::new().classes(["Alacritty"]),
//!         WindowRuleCondition::new().tags([&tag.get("2", None)?]),
//!     ]);
//! ```
//!
//! This condition applies if the window has the class "Alacritty" *and* opens on tag "2".
//!
//! You can write the above a bit shorter, as top level conditions are already "all":
//!
//! ```
//! let cond = WindowRuleCondition::new()
//!     .classes(["Alacritty"])
//!     .tags([&tag.get("2", None)?]);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Complex condition composition
//! You can arbitrarily nest `any` and `all` to achieve desired logic.
//!
//! ```
//! let op = output.get_by_name("HDMI-1")?;
//! let tag1 = tag.get("1", &op)?;
//! let tag2 = tag.get("2", &op)?;
//!
//! let complex_cond = WindowRuleCondition::new()
//!     .any([
//!         WindowRuleCondition::new().all([
//!             WindowRuleCondition::new()
//!                 .classes("Alacritty")
//!                 .tags([&tag1, &tag2])
//!         ]),
//!         WindowRuleCondition::new().all([
//!             WindowRuleCondition::new().any([
//!                 WindowRuleCondition::new().titles(["nvim", "emacs", "nano"]),
//!             ]),
//!             WindowRuleCondition::new().any([
//!                 WindowRuleCondition::new().tags([&tag1, &tag2]),
//!             ]),
//!         ])
//!     ])
//! ```
//!
//! The above is true if either of the following are true:
//! - The window has class "Alacritty" and opens on both tags "1" and "2", or
//! - The window's class is either "nvim", "emacs", or "nano" *and* it opens on either tag "1" or
//!   "2".
//!
//! # [`WindowRule`]s
//! `WindowRuleCondition`s are half of a window rule. The other half is the [`WindowRule`] itself.
//!
//! A `WindowRule` is what will apply to a window if a condition is true.
//!
//! ## Building `WindowRule`s
//!
//! Create a new window rule with [`WindowRule::new`]:
//!
//! ```
//! let rule = WindowRule::new();
//! ```
//!
//! There are several rules you can set currently.
//!
//! ### [`WindowRule::output`]
//! This will cause the window to open on the specified output.
//!
//! ### [`WindowRule::tags`]
//! This will cause the window to open with the given tags.
//!
//! ### [`WindowRule::floating`]
//! This will cause the window to open either floating or tiled.
//!
//! ### [`WindowRule::fullscreen_or_maximized`]
//! This will cause the window to open either fullscreen, maximized, or neither.
//!
//! ### [`WindowRule::x`]
//! This will cause the window to open at the given x-coordinate.
//!
//! Note: this only applies to floating windows; tiled windows' geometry will be overridden by
//! layouting.
//!
//! ### [`WindowRule::y`]
//! This will cause the window to open at the given y-coordinate.
//!
//! Note: this only applies to floating windows; tiled windows' geometry will be overridden by
//! layouting.
//!
//! ### [`WindowRule::width`]
//! This will cause the window to open with the given width in pixels.
//!
//! Note: this only applies to floating windows; tiled windows' geometry will be overridden by
//! layouting.
//!
//! ### [`WindowRule::height`]
//! This will cause the window to open with the given height in pixels.
//!
//! Note: this only applies to floating windows; tiled windows' geometry will be overridden by
//! layouting.
